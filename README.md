In this article, I will show you how to use Git to clone and remote a GitHub repository from your local machine. We will also apply Git branching and merging to the repository we have created.

In general (not everyone), most people when learn git basics still do not fully understand how to implement Git branching and merging in a GitHub repository. As a result, some may feel less confident when creating a new branch in a repository and then merging it.

Hopefully, through this article, you will gain a better understanding of how to apply or use Git branching and merging in a GitHub repository.

Prerequisite

    Github Account. You must have a github account in github website (https://github.com/). Please register a new github account if you don’t have the github account.
    Git Command. You must download and install git in your local machine/laptop. For Downloading the git, please refer to this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads
    Code Editor (Visual Studio Code). If you don’t have Visual studio code or code editor in your local machine/computer. Please download and install the code editor app. (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

    In this article, you will learn about:

    How to Create and Remote the Github Repository From Local Machine.
    How to implementing Branches Using Git Branch and Git Merge.

Step 1 — Create folder and file in your local machine/computer

Create a new folder in your local machine/computer named “test_git” (for an example). We will use that folder as a working directory to remote our repository in github.

Open your code editor (Ex: Visual Studio Code, etc). After that, open the folder that you have prepared earlier in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code), then click on the “File” menu -> “Open Folder”, and select the folder you previously created on your computer. Or, you can also drag and drop the folder directly into VS Code, and the folder will be open.

If the folder (test_git) is already open in VS Code, the display will look like the image below.
